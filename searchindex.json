{"categories":[],"posts":[{"content":"This post explores asking prices of real estate in Tampere between October 2017 and January 2022. I will look on how it changed in time, and will examine different categories, like new property, resold property, apartments, row houses and family houses, and I will summarize it on map, like this:\nIf you aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in anything besides the price map, you can see it here.\nData I work with a dataset consisting of real estate ads that was scraped from Google Search cache.\nTo study the change of the prices in time, I create a data structure with items for every day from the 4 years, where there are all the rental ads that were up some time during that day. So that if ad_1 was published only on 2018-01-04; ad_2, ad_3 and ad_4 were published on 2018-01-04 and 2018-01-05; and ad_5 only on 2018-01-05, the data structure will look as:\nDate published ads 2018-01-04 ad_1, ad_2, ad_3, ad_4 2018-01-05 ad_2, ad_3, ad_4, ad_5 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; We see that a data item can be included in more than one date. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s included in the field for every day when it was published. I study the price day by day for the entire 4 years.\nOne of the most important things I realized while working on this, is that pricing of new and resold real estate is very different and worth to study separately.\nNumber of new and resold property ads Here we can see the volume of real estate selling ads for Tampere per day. New real estate is plotted in blue and resold in green. There is some data missing from October 2019 to Feburary 2020, my tooling went off unnoticed.\nThere was a lot of new housing coming to market in 2018 and 2019. In both categories, there is less and less real estate for sale since mid-2019.\nSelling price growth Let\u0026rsquo;s first take all of the days, count median m²-price, and then plot it. New real estate is plotted in blue and resold in green.\nBetween 2018 and 2022, median price of new real estate grew my 24% (~4600 to ~5700 per m2) and median price of resold real estate grew by 48% (~2500 to ~3700 per m2). As there was a lot of new housing coming to market in the last 4 years, it also got resold (within the measured time period), and that might explain so big price growth for the resold property.\nPrice development of apartments vs row vs family houses (resold property) Here I populate each day with the listed ads, and further split them to 3 categories by type:\nKerrostalo and Luhtitalo Rivitalo and Paritalo Omakotitalo I only explore the categories in the resold property. The new items seem to be statistically different and don\u0026rsquo;t capture behavior of individuals.\nI merge the row and pair houses because I think they are very similar in characteristics and not worth to look at separately. Same for apartments in blocks and in loft houses.\nWe can see that the apartment prices rose fastest. Family and row houses stayed pretty much the same until December 2020 when the price of family houses in Tampere started to rise. In the end of 2021, also the price of row houses jumped up.\nPrice map of Tampere To present asking the data by location, I created following visualization. Area of Tampere is arbitrarily split to hexagonal cells. Ads are grouped by cell, and several statistics are computed per cell\nmedian price of ads in the cell, in €/m² number of ads in the cell average of year built in the cell slope and intercept of least-squares regression line of propery area vs property price The cells are then colored based on selected metric.\nDouble-click on a cell will open a detailed view which lists ads posted in the last 4 years. It also show a scatter plot of property are vs property price, and the regression line. Point on the scatter plot are colored based on how recently the ad was posted.\nThe map is here.\n","id":0,"section":"posts","summary":"This post explores asking prices of real estate in Tampere between October 2017 and January 2022.

It\u0026rsquo;s by far not complete, but it\u0026rsquo;s representative enough.\nThe displayed volume is amount of apartments, row houses, pair houses and family houses for sale. It includes all the forms of ownership. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t include plots, garages and holiday homes. It includes both new and \u0026ldquo;second-hand\u0026rdquo; real estate.\nI am now thinking that I should explore new and resold separately. It would capture the difference in behavior of developers and regular people.\nThe whole Finland The first plot shows the total number of all the advertised real estate for sale in Finland. We can see the peak was in summer 2018 with about 67000 items for sale. The lowest point is in the end of observation period (January 2022) with only about 38000 items for sale, that\u0026rsquo;s about 43% drop.\nWe can also see a yearly repeating trend. There is most real estate for sale during summer (July) and least after the beginning of the year. I guess this is somehow connected with finishing building projects. New real estate accounts for a very large portion of advertised real estate (at least in the last 8 years in Finland).\nWe can see that the covid pandemic (April 2020 further) didn\u0026rsquo;t really make much of a difference. Years 2019 and 2020 are very alike, just with an offset of about 20000.\nI then display the volume for the biggest 11 municipalities in Finland. The city volume is blue, and the whole-Finland volume is in light green on different scale, to compare the trend.\nMost of the cities follow the total trend, with the exceptions of\nVantaa, where the volume of sold real estate droppedby 54% in 2 years - from ~3300 (summer 2018) to ~1500 (summer 2020). It seems that nothing was build there in 2019 and 2020. Jyväskylä, where there was quite a boom last year (2021), bringing the volume of residential real estate for sale almost at the level of 2018, which was the volume peak for the whole Finland The cities are\nHelsinki Espoo Tampere Vantaa Oulu Turku Jyväskylä Kuopio Lahti Joensuu Pori Helsinki Espoo Tampere Vantaa Oulu Turku Jyväskylä Kuopio Lahti Joensuu Pori Volume per resident In order to compare the seld real estate volume between various cities, it\u0026rsquo;s useful to relate the volume to number of residents in the municipality. I chose to display how many residents there are per one sold real estate unit. The more residents per one item, the more the \u0026ldquo;scarce\u0026rdquo; the real estate is.\nHelsinki and Turku I observed that the number of residents per sold unit was really high in Helsinki and Turku. Both are relatively small (245.63 km2 resp 214.19 km2), densely populated municipalites with lots of rental housing. Both are offset by neighboring municipalities, Vantaa and Espoo for Helsinki and Rasio and Kaarina for Turku. The count goes as high as 200 rsidents per one real estate ad.\nOther populous municipalities The other municipalities show similar pattern, except for Vantaa, where real estate for sale was scarce already in 2020. It seems that people started to buy a lot of Vantaa proeprty when the Covid hit (April 2020). The most real estate to buy per capita has almost always been in Kupio with as little ~50 residents per one real estate ad.\n","id":1,"section":"posts","summary":"This post shows how the residential real estate market in Finland changed in terms of volume in years 2018-2022.\nVolume Data I work with a dataset of sell ads that I scraped from Google search cache between October 2017 and January 2022.

The rental prices should follow the selling prices. In this post I explore how the rental prices of apartments in Tamere grew in the last 3 years (2018, 2019, 2020), and I find subsets of the rental items, which show different rate of growth, e.g. expensive apartments vs cheap apartments, small apartments vs large apartments, apartments in different neighborhoods.\nData I work with the same dataset as in the post about rental prices in Tampere. I remove outliers in the same manner. This time I only consider apartments within 8.5 km from the center of Tampere.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t do any deduplication here. There will more ads for one apartment in the dataset, but it\u0026rsquo;s OK, because they will be counted only for the days when they were published.\nBecause I want to see price development of existing real estate, I need to remove all the ads for apartments built after the beginning of the measurement - I drop all items with year-built after the end of 2017. There is about 30000 items in the dataset - 30000 rental ads for apartments in Tampere.\nTo study the change of the prices in time, I create a data structure with items for every day from the 3 years, where there are all the rental ads that were up some time during that day. So that if ad_1 was published only on 2018-01-04; ad_2, ad_3 and ad_4 were published on 2018-01-04 and 2018-01-05; and ad_5 only on 2018-01-05, the data structure will look as:\nDate published ads 2018-01-04 ad_1, ad_2, ad_3, ad_4 2018-01-05 ad_2, ad_3, ad_4, ad_5 \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; We see that a data item can be included in more than one date. In fact, it\u0026rsquo;s included in the field for every day when it was published. I study the price day by day for the entire 3 years.\nRent growth Let\u0026rsquo;s first take all of the days, count median m²-price for every day, and then plot it (blue). I also plot the number of rental ads published in particular day (green).\nWe can see the median apartment rental price in a day in blue, and number of ads in a day in green. Both are actually 30-day rolling averages, just so the plot looks better. We can see that the market of rental apartments is regularly at its lowest in September, after the summer holidays, when school and university starts.\nThe median price oscillates up and down but it obviously follows an upward trend. It would be good to measure the rate of the growth. I decided to fit prices in all the days of the 3 years into a linear function - essentially a line that has some vertical offset (mean price in the beginning of the measurements), and a constant rate of change over time - i.e. how much the rent increases per day or year \u0026ldquo;on average\u0026rdquo;. The fitted (dashed) line starts at 13.3 in the beginning of 2018, and ends at 14.3 in the end of 2020. The measured rate of change of the fitted line is then 1.03 €/m² in the 3 years, that\u0026rsquo;s 7.8 % growth.\nTo illustrate, 7.8% growth means that if, in January 2018, an average 50 m² apartment in Tampere was 50*13.3 = 665 €/month, in December 2020, it is expected to be 50*14.3 = 715 €/month.\nTo understand the situation beter, we need to observe the price growth for various apartment categories. Following sections will categorize rental items based on features, and identify categories with different rate of growth.\nPrice categories I wonder if the rent has risen more for cheap or for expensive apartments. In order to compare, I split the ads into price categories and measure medians of the categories.\nI first divide the apartments to 4 same-size price categories. For each day, I count median for each of these groups - there will be the quarter of the cheapest apartments (cheapest), the quarter below median (cheap), quarter above median (expensive), and quarter of the most expensive apartments (most expensive).\nI then display change of the 4 categories over the course of the measured 3 years.\nWe see that the rent growth is most steep for the expensive apartments (quarter above median) - 9.8% in 3 years. Rental price of the cheapest third grew only by 5.4%.\nAge of the apartment The age of aparment is an important factor of rental price. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore whether the rent in newer apartments grew faster than rent in old apartments. I divide the data to 4 age groups by year built:\nbuilt between 1910 and 1963 built between 1963 and 1986 built between 1986 and 2009 built between 2009 and 2017 Let\u0026rsquo;s first see how were apartments of different age proportionally published in the three years:\nWe see that a lot of cold-war era (1963-1986) apartments was put to the market in the first half of 2020. I wonder if this is connected to Covid-19.\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s see how the rent per m² developed for apartments in different age groups:\nRent grew fastest for the pre-1963 apartments (7.3 % in 3 years), and then for the cold-war apartments (6.7 % in 3 years). For apatrments built between 1986 and 2009, rent grew only by 3.7 %.\nNeighborhood Let\u0026rsquo;s explore how the rent developed in various locations in Tampere. I divide the ads to neighborhoods by postal areas. The amount of ads per neighborhood varies in time. To understand the supply of rentals from neighborhood over time, following stack plot shows amount of ads in 10 most rental-popular neighborhoods.\nWe can see that the most rental ads are from Hervanta, probably because it\u0026rsquo;s quite populous and the University is there. There was a sudden influx of rentals in Kaleva in August 2019 and in Itä-Amuri-Tammerkoski in September 2020. I think these are old apartment buildings that went through complete renovation, whole building at once. In the age distribuition plot above, we can see that those 2 spikes are pre-1963 apartments.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s difficult to display price development in all the neighborhoods in a readable manner. Here is the top 5 most rental-popular areas in a single plot.\nWe can see that the rents grew fastest in Kaukajärvi and Kaleva. In Tampere-Keskus the rental prices grew very little in comparison.\nThere were actually 16 areas of Tampere worth showing, and I realized it\u0026rsquo;s not possible to put them together in one line plot. It\u0026rsquo;s better to summarize the area rent growth in a table. The following table shows regressed price in January 2018, regressed price in December 2020, and the percentual growth. You can click on the column headers to sort by the criterion.\nI also show the percentual rental price growth on a map. The more blue, the faster the rental price grew in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\nBy looking at the map, it seems that the rent grow a lot in Kaleva, Kaukajärvi and Luoteis-Tampere. In the center, except for the mid-southern part (Tampere Keskus Läntinen), rental price only by 1-4% in 3 years.\nIn Tesoma there was a lot of new development in the last 3 years, and I think that\u0026rsquo;s the reason for the stagnation of the rent lever in older housing.\nArea Another criterion for apartment category is the size (area). I divide the apartments to 4 groups of the same size. I.e. in the 3 years of rental ads in Tampere, there was a similar amount of apartments in these 4 area categories:\n0-36 m² 36-49 m² 49-60 m² 60-160 m² Here is the plot of the rental price development in time:\nWe can see that the price growth is most significant in the second smallest group (just below average area). Rents grew slowest for aparments above 49 and below 60 m².\nConclusion Overall, the rent increase over the 3 years (2018-2020) in Tampere was about 7.8%.\nRent grew faster for\nslightly-above-average-priced apartents old (pre-1963) apartments, and less so for pre-1986 apartments Kaukajärvi, Luoteis-Tampere, Kaleva apartments sized 36-49 m², and smaller too Rent grew slower for\nvery cheap apartments apartments built in 90s and 00s Takahuhti, Tesoma and overall the center of Tamere except for Tampere Keskus Läntinen apartments larger than 49 m² ","id":2,"section":"posts","summary":"In cities, the price of real estate is growing since ever.

I hope it will be interesting for someone who\u0026rsquo;s renting (or letting), to understand the situation better. I will not explore price development over time in this post, but I will write another one on the topic.\nData I work with a dataset of rental ads that I scraped from Google search cache in 2018, 2019 and 2020. It\u0026rsquo;s by far not complete, but it\u0026rsquo;s representative enough.\nOutlier Removal It\u0026rsquo;s good to remove data that will not contribute to examined statistics. For this post I only consider apartments in block and loft houses (\u0026ldquo;kerrostalo\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;luhtitalo\u0026rdquo;), I don\u0026rsquo;t look at row and pair houses. I also removed short term \u0026ldquo;business\u0026rdquo; (forenom) apartments, single rooms, and obvious typos.\nDeduplication Within the 3 years of the data gathering, some apartments show up more than once. It happens when an advertised apartment is let, then the tenant leaves, and the owner advertises the apartment again. For the analysis in this post, the duplicates are unwanted - if we count an average price of apartments in an area, we don\u0026rsquo;t want a signle apartment to be counted more than once. It\u0026rsquo;s different than tracking price development over time.\nI deduplicate by grouping by street address, apartment area and floor number. If there are two (or more) ads on the same street address of the same size on the same floor, I only pick the latest one. There is about 40000 ads that passed the previous cleaning, and after deduplication only 24000 was left.\nArea of Interest I start with rental apartments in 15 km circle from the center. That includes also Ylöjärvi, Nokia, Pirkkala, Hervanta, and probably couple of more small places. You can see the circle on following image. The colorful mess are rasterized datapoints, colored based on m²-price, I will explain it later. There\u0026rsquo;s about 24000 datapoints.\nWe see that the amount of rental apartments decreases with the distance from the center. Let\u0026rsquo;s see the density and cumulative histograms of distance to the center of Tampere, to get the idea of how much rental property is there over a distance from the center.\nThe left (upper) histogram shows that there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of rentals within 2 km from the center, then not so much (when the circle expands over the lakes), and then after 4 km the circle captures the coast of Härmälä on the south, and Niemi in the northwest. One of the peaks between 6 and 8 km is Hervanta. The small bump around 13 km is Nokia.\nThe right histogram shows that, from the 24k ads, one half (12k) is within 4.5 km from the city center. Only 3000 ads are further than 8 km. This indicates that the 15 km radius is too much, and perhaps the 8 would suffice.\nFactors of Aparment Rental Price The metric - €/m²/month How to compare rental price of many apartments given that apartments come in diferrent sizes? An obvious measure is price per m². If a 50 m² apartment is 750 €/month, its price per m² is 15. As it\u0026rsquo;s a rental price, It\u0026rsquo;s 15 €/m²/month. Let\u0026rsquo;s see the histogram of price per m² for all the apartments within 15 km from the center of Tampere. I plot 2 categories - apartments within 4 km from the center, and apartments further than 4 km (until 15 km).\nFrom the histograms we can see that\napartments under 12 €/m²/month are mostly further away than 4 km median m²-price for apartments closer than 4 km is ~14 €, that\u0026rsquo;s 700 €/month for 50 m² apartment median m²-price for apartments further than 4 km is ~12 €, that\u0026rsquo;s 600 €/month for 50 m² apartment there is a peak around 14 € in the blue histogram, indicating that portion of the 4-15km data is more similar to the \u0026lt;4km category Apartment Location It would be good to see how expensive are areas of Tampere on the map. It\u0026rsquo;s not reasonable to plot all the rental ads, there\u0026rsquo;s too many of them, and they are not well distributed. Rather, I split the area to a grid and aggregate datapoints in a square cell (about 100x100 meters). The cell is then displayed on the map and colored by the mean m² price of all the datapoints within. The yellow squares are 10 €/m²/month (500 € for 50 m² apartment), and the blue ones are 30 €/m²/month (1500 €/month for 50 m² apartment). The color bar is on the right. You can use mouse wheel for map zoom.\nIf you hover your mouse cursor over a color, the tooltip will show\nthe m² price of the cell price for 50 m² apartment with such m² price how many datapoints are in the cell average construction year in the cell Distance from the Center Let\u0026rsquo;s see how distance from the center affects rental m² price. I show it in a rich boxplot.\nObviously, centrally located apartments are more expensive, but the correlation is a bit chaotic.\nNeighborhood Location as a factor of rental price can also be shown based on municipal areas. I picked areas of postal codes, because the boundaries can be downloaded from Statistics Finland. I managed to get a geojson with polygons of postal areas, where there are also\ndemographic data (number of inhabitants, males/females, age groups) household and individual income data number of rental-occupied and owner-occupied households In following choropleth, I show postal areas and for each of them\nthe average m²-price price of 50 m² apartment based on the average number of rental ads in the area number of inhabitants how many more percent of women than men live the area number of rental-occupied vs owner-occupied households median household income By default, the area will be colored based on the mean m²-price, but you can select other metric for the color. You can also zoom with mouse scroll.\nThe polygons and data about income, household and demography are from dataset Postal code area boundaries, downloaded from Statistics Finland\u0026rsquo;s interface service on 1 January 2021 with the licence CC BY 4.0.\nYear Built Intuituvely, older apartments are cheaper and newer apartments are more expensive. In following rich boxplot, I show what\u0026rsquo;s the median price, and what is the most common price range, for aparments built in particular year.\nHere we observe that\naverage rental price of 50 m² apartment built before 1963 is ~800 €/month average rental price of 50 m² apartment built 1963-1983 is ~600 €/month not so many apartments were built in 80s and 90s (note the histogram above the box plot) there was a huge development boom after 2015 apartment rental price grows quite steeply and linearly for the last decade (2010-2020) I was most surprised by the drop of the price for apartments from the 70s and by the steepness of the price raise in the last decade.\nConsidering a 50 m² apartment, each year of age between 2009 and 2021 will raise the monthly rental price by 47.5 € - for items built in 2009 it\u0026rsquo;s 676 € and for items (planned to be) built in 2021 it\u0026rsquo;s 1000 €.\nConclusion I don\u0026rsquo;t really have any conclusion here, I leave it up to the reader. There are factors that I omitted, for example effect of apartment size on it\u0026rsquo;s m² price. It would be higher for smaller apartment and lower for large ones, and I don\u0026rsquo;t see it as an interesting statistic.\nOther factors which would be worth researching are\nsauna in the apartment - is apartment with sauna worth more in rent? This could be interesting for developers, who consider expenses for apartment block construction. floor location - are apartments on top floors more expensive and how much? heating type - how electric heating, central heating, water floor heating project to rental price time of the year of rental ad publishing - when\u0026rsquo;s the best time to let/rent an apartment ","id":3,"section":"posts","summary":"In this post, I will explore and show how various features of an apartment (age, location, year built) affect rental price in the city of Tampere.

For example, to see how rental apartment area affects its monthly price. The first visualization that would come to my mind is scatter plot, and I argue that scatter plot is not descriptive enough to offer good understanding of the simple case of two 1d statistics. I propose a rich boxplot visualization that gives better overview of the correlation to the reader.\nExample data Given about 24000 rental ads for apartments in Tampere, Finland in the last 3 years, perhaps in a DataFrame with two columns \u0026ldquo;area\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;price\u0026rdquo;, these are the distributions of apartment size in square meters, and apartment price in EUR per month.\n| You can see that the histogram of apartment size is peaky, developers stick to certain apartment sizes. As there are many new high blocks of flats, the apartment sizes are the same for apartments above and below in the same block. The peaks can be seen as popular apartment sizes in Tampere. There\u0026rsquo;s 25 m², 32 m², 39 m², 45 m², 52 m², 59 m² and then 75 m².\nThe price is less peaky and more \u0026ldquo;naturally\u0026rdquo; (normally) distributed. Median is 680 EUR, but there is another peak around 600.\nI have already removed some outlier categories, for example:\nshort-term hotel-like apartments (Forenom), where 25 m² studio comes to 1200 EUR/month single rooms - listings of area \u0026lt;20 m² listings out of sensible range for price and area Scatter Plot Now it would be good to see how the apartment size relates to the rental price. Let\u0026rsquo;s scatter plot. Scatter plot is a 2d plot where each data point (row in our dataframe) is displayed on [x,y] coordinates [area,price]. This is a scatter plot of area and price of rental apartments in Tampere:\nThe blue dots are the datapoints, and the black line is a linear function fitted from all the datapoints. The line (linear function) says that, given no data but the apartment size, you can estimate rental price of an apartment in Tampere by solving\nPrice [EUR] = 362 + 7.1 * Size [m²]\n.. so for 50 m² we get 717 EUR, which seems about right by looking at the scatter plot. It would be interesting to see what those coefficients (362 and 7.1) would be for other cities in Finland.\nWe can get a good feel of the relationship between the two distributions from the scatter plot and fitted linear function. However, coming from the histograms, we lose information about local density of the data. We don\u0026rsquo;t know how strong is the evidence for particular apartment size (or size interval). The linear function is surely more precise for median-sized apartments than for large ones (more than 100 m²) because those are much less common. We also have very limited information about how much the price spreads for a particular apartment size.\nEven though we only investigate apartment size as a factor of price, it\u0026rsquo;s also interesting to see to what extent is the the price affected by the other features (year built, location, amenities, ..). We can get the idea by examining how much the price varies for a given size interval, e.g. what is the price range for the most common half of apartments between 49 and 51 m². Looking at the scatter plot, I could guess that it will be from ~600 to ~800, but I have no means to qualitatively compare this guess to other size ranges.\nFurthermore, a linear function will not have good information value for non-linear relationships, e.g. age of an apartment - very old (1950s) and very new (2010s) apartments will be more expensive than apartments built in the middle of the era (1980s).\nRich boxplot The variance can be explained by using a boxplot. For some reason, boxplots are mostly used in scientific papers, and display dependency of numeric variable on a categorical variable, think sth like petal lenghts of species of the Iris flower.\nIn order to transform the scatter plot to be more informative, I decided to bin the control variable (size), and display the median and the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles of prices in the bin. It\u0026rsquo;s not too hard to compute that, for apartments between 49 and 51 m², there is 1208 datapoints, the median price is 710 cheapest 25% of the apartments are below 650 (0.25 quantile) and the cheapest 75% of the apartments are below 780 (0.75 quantile). This means that the most common half of 49-51 m² apartments in Tampere are between 650 and 780 EUR per month.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take the 2D space from the scatter plot and imagine a rectangle with vertical edges on the apartment size interval bounds, and horizontal edges on the 25% and 75% percentile prices, with a dot on the median price level. for the example from previous paragraph, it would be a rectangle between points [49,650], [51,650], [51, 780] and [49, 780], with a dot on [50, 715]. If we divide all the size range into intervals, and then transform all of them into such rectangles, the plot will look like this:\nYou can hover over a rectangle and the tooltip will show parameters of the bin. I added histograms for both of the statistics (above and on the left), and I adjust intensity of the bin based on how many samples are in it. the darker the bin, the more samples it contain. I don\u0026rsquo;t show borders of the size interval, but rather the middle value from the interval. The width of the bin/interval is not important, and can be roughly estimated from the mid-value distance.\nThe rich boxplot will show how much the price values disperse based on the apartment size. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t only report the relationship between the variables but also the quality of the data in the range.\n","id":4,"section":"posts","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s often useful to visually understand how one statistic relates to another. For example, to see how rental apartment area affects its monthly price. The first visualization that would come to my mind is scatter plot, and I argue that scatter plot is not descriptive enough to offer good understanding of the simple case of two 1d statistics. I propose a rich boxplot visualization that gives better overview of the correlation to the reader.","tags":["visualization","statistics","correlation"],"title":"Rich Boxplot","uri":"https://t0mk.github.io/posts/rich-boxplot/","year":"2020"}],"tags":[]}
